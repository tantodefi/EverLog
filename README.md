### Workflow

## Overview

An indexer extracts transaction data from a blockchain node, transforms it into a readable format, and loads it into a database for easy querying. On-chain data is not searchable by default, which is a challenge for developers building dApps that can interact with on-chain data. The ability to query on-chain data is crucial for efficient and user-friendly dApps.

### What EverLog offers

- **Effortless Event Retrieval:** No more sifting through raw blockchain data. EverLog categorizes and indexes events, making them readily accessible for exploration and analysis.

- **Seamless Integration:** Integrate EverLog with your existing dApps or applications to gain valuable insights from past and ongoing blockchain activity.

- **Powerful Querying:** Utilize an intuitive interface to filter and search through logged events, allowing you to pinpoint specific information with ease.

- **Secure Storage:** Rest assured that your data is protected. EverLog leverages a robust database to ensure the safe and reliable storage of collected blockchain events.
